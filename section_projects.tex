    {UBC Unmanned Aircraft Systems Team --- Team Captain}{JAN 2014 --- JUN 2018}
    {\website{https://www.ubcuas.com/}{Website}}{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Led a team of 35 members from 2017-2018 Unmanned systems Canada competition that
                  was recognized for outstanding communication, process,and consistently in the top
                  5 each year
            \item Architected the next generation of UAS ground control station software in C++ that
                  parses a MAVLink stream sent via UDP/TCP, geotag images retrieved from the drone,
                  and autonomously operate an Arduino based antenna tracker
            \item Engineered a variable length message format in C++ to help send data between any
                  UBC UAS micro-controllers (over TCP/IP or Serial) resulting in a unified 
                  communication protocol and easier system development and maintenance
            \item Designed an expandable and reliable software communications protocol utilizing 
                  CRCs and COBS, resulting in reliable data transmission and a significant reduction
                  in corrupted data processing
            \item Implemented a new documentation and issue tracking system using JIRA and
                  Confluence resulting an increase in project efficiency and completion
        \end{itemize}
    }

    \project
    {Extended FreeRTOS Raspberry PI 2B Port}{SEP 2018 --- Present}{}{
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Implemented EDF scheduling in FreeRTOS kernel to allow for higher processor
              utilization
        \item Collaborated on the design and implementation of SRP and single stack sharing to
              prevent priority inversion as well as reduce FreeRTOS memory footprint.
        \item Extended FreeRTOS to support Constant Bandwidth Servers allowing users to handle
              aperiodic tasks with strict timing guarantees
        \item Collaborated on extending FreeRTOS by allowing users to utilize multi core partitioned
              scheduling to achieve greater processor utilization
        \end{itemize}
    }

    \project
    {Designed and Implemented Extensions For OS161}{JAN 2018 --- MAY 2018}{}{
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Implemented locks, condition variables and semaphores at kernel level allowing user
              multithreaded applications to run
        \item Designed and implemented file tables in the kernel allowing for file sharing between
              processes thus allowing user programs to share open file descriptors
        \item Architected a process id system that enabled kernel process management, and
              processes to fork and wait for each other
        \item Designed a virtual memory system and page daemon that enabled memory reuse and virtual
              address separation
        \end{itemize}
    }
