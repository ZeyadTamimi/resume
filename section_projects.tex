    \project
    {Extended FreeRTOS Raspberry PI 2B Port}{SEP 2018 --- DEC 2018}{}{
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Implemented EDF scheduling in FreeRTOS kernel to allow for higher processor
              utilization
        \item Collaborated on the design and implementation of SRP and single stack sharing to
              prevent priority inversion as well as reducing FreeRTOS memory footprint
        \item Extended FreeRTOS to support Constant Bandwidth Servers allowing aperiodic tasks to
              run with strict timing guarantees
        \item Collaborated on extending FreeRTOS by utilizing SMT on the BCM2837B0 CPU allowing
              users to run partitioned and global EDF increasing CPU utilization
        \end{itemize}

    {UBC Unmanned Aircraft Systems Team --- Team Captain}{JAN 2014 --- JUN 2018}
    {\website{https://www.ubcuas.com/}{Website}}{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Led a team of 35 members from 2017-2018 Unmanned systems Canada competition that
                  was recognized for outstanding communication, process, and consistently in the top
                  5 each year
            \item Architected the next generation of UAS ground control station software in C++ that
                  parses a MAVLink stream sent via UDP/TCP, geotag images retrieved from the drone,
                  and autonomously operate an Arduino based antenna tracker
            \item Engineered a variable length message format in C++ to help send data between any
                  UBC UAS micro-controllers (over TCP/IP or Serial) leading to a unified
                  communication protocol and easier system development and maintenance
            \item Designed an expandable and reliable software communication protocol utilizing
                  CRCs and COBS, producing reliable data transmission and a significant reduction
                  in corrupted data processing
            \item Implemented a new documentation and issue tracking system using JIRA and
                  Confluence resulting in an increase of project efficiency and completion
        \end{itemize}
    }
    \project
    {Designed and Implemented Extensions For OS161}{JAN 2018 --- MAY 2018}{}{
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Implemented locks, condition variables and semaphores at kernel level allowing user
              multithreaded applications to run
        \item Designed and implemented file tables in the kernel allowing file sharing between
              processes thus allowing user programs to share open file descriptors
        \item Architected a process id system that enabled kernel process management, and
              processes to fork and wait for each other
        \item Designed a virtual memory system and page daemon that enabled memory reuse and virtual
              address separation
        \end{itemize}
    }
    \project
    {Turreted Camera and Rubber Band Launcher with a touchscreen}{JAN 2017 --- MAY 2017}{}{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Led a team of 4 to create a turreted camera and rubber band launcher using a
                  DE1-SOC FPGA that can be controlled from a touchscreen or Bluetooth and achieved
                  one of the top 3 teams in the class
            \item Implemented a Motorola 6850 serial port using Verilog, enabling a soft-core
                  processor to communicate with up to 4 peripherals at a time using the Altera
                  Avalon Interface
            \item Created generic C Serial Library that communicates with the memory mapped
                  Motorola 6850 serial ports resulting in quicker application development times and
                  reduced code duplication
            \item Implemented image processing workflow by integrating a C JPEG decoder into a
                  NIOS system which decodes images from the camera and send them to a Verilog GPU core
                  to be displayed on a touch screen
        \end{itemize}
