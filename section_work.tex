    {SEP --- DEC 2018 \\ SEP --- DEC 2017} {
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Lectured students about the principles of CI/CD, DevOps, and Infrastructure as code
        \item Delivered a tutorial on REST API and application development to the entire student
              cohort
        \item Supervised student projects and provided guidance on proper software engineering
              practices
        \item Mentored students on the process of developing operating systems resulting in students
              becoming comfortable with memory management, process tables, file tables,
            and concurrency
      \end{itemize}

    {ARISTA Networks}{Software Engineering Intern}{Platform Team and Infrastructure Team}
    {JAN --- SEP 2018}{
      \begin{itemize}
        % Talk about parity - Registers / Tables
        \item Spearheaded a project to migrate multi-threaded code to event loop architecture
              reducing platform complexity and decreasing race condition related bugs
        \item Collaborated with a senior engineer to implement register parity error handling for
              switching ASICs, reducing the number of fatal errors and improving switch up-times
        \item Implemented customer facing CLI commands to expose various parity error reporting
              statistics
        % TODO Talk about a bug with all interrupts disabled
        % Talk about Testing Infra
        \item Architected a python based testing framework to unify parity testing procedures
              across 3 different platform teams reducing code duplication and resolving countless
              test bugs
        %\item Improved multiple parity correction memory scanning routines resulting in parity
        %      correction speedup
        % Talk about software infra
        \item Developed auto code migration tool to migrate ARISTA's millions of source files and
              commits from P4 to Git in order to improve company development workflow
        %TODO Talk about ops
      \end{itemize}

    {MAY --- AUG 2017}{
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Assisted in the creation of an actionable model of locality that allows for better
              cache utilization and better program performance
        \item Designed a C++ arena allocator that can take in “hints” at allocation time to help
              decide which arena to use increasing program locality
        \item Applied the actionable locality model principles to various benchmarks
              (e.g mesh traversal) and achieved a \~{}15\% performance gain
      \end{itemize}

    {Garmin}{Firmware Engineering Intern}{ANT Wireless Team}
    {MAY --- DEC 2016}
    {
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Designed a new scriptable and unified testing framework which increased efficiency,
              and decreased debug and validation times
        \item Modified the ANT Firmware in C to add up to 256 Byte variable message length
              capability to ANT protocol, allowing for high throughput data to be transmitted using
              ANT devices
        \item Planned and developed serial TTY support for the ANT Library, allowing Garmin’s
              clients to use ANT devices natively on LINUX without external libraries or drivers
      \end{itemize}
